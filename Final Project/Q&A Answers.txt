Questions:
What did you like about this project?
This project taught me how different Java classes work together to create a working student enrolment system. It taught me how to read Java as a programming language and also gave me a glimpse on how unit tests and Exception handling works.

What did you struggle with in this project?
I struggled most with how rigid the Java syntax was. Often times, I would miss out on a semi colon or declare a variable in a wrong type and it would take me ages to debug. I also struggled at the initial stages of unit testing since getting jUnit to work with intelliJ idea was quite complicated. Martin was very helpful and I managed to get it to work with his guidance.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
The time given to complete this assessment was very short. It would be better if we could have at least a week to learn, absorb and apply the Java concepts.
